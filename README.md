## Building and running

This project uses CMake and Make to build it.

To configure, first run `cmake -B build`. This will generate a `build` folder with all build instructions.
CONFIGURATION ONLY NEEDS TO BE RUN ONCE

To compile, `cd` into the `build` folder and run `make`.

To run the runner, simply run the executable in `RideShare/build/exec/` called `RideShareRunner`.
